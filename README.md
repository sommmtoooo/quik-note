# Quik Note

Welcome to **Quik Note!** 📓

Quik Note is a minimal web application designed to demonstrate the practical application of one-to-one and one-to-many entity relationships to my relational database (MySQL) students. This was built to help those who are struggling to grasp these concepts, this project aims to make them more relatable and engaging. By showcasing a real-world use case, I hope to spark their interest and make database relationships more tangible and exciting.
